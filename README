This is a portable public domain password hashing framework for use in PHP
applications.

This is an exact copy of the phpass source code from http://www.openwall.com,
but if you're worried about authenticity, you might want to just download the
original from http://www.openwall.com/phpass/.  I created this project on
GitHub so that it can be used as a git submodule in other projects.
